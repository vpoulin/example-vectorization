# example-vectorization
Examples of vectorization and exploration with ThisNotThat.

In this notebook, we explain the notion of list of tokens. For instance:
* Recipes are unordered list of ingredient tokens.
* Documents are ordered lists of word tokens.
* Sessions are ordered lists of command tokens.
* URLs are ordered lists of character tokens.

We explain the different strategies rather it makes sense to first vectorize the tokens or not, rather you want to treat your lists as ordered or unordered, etc.
